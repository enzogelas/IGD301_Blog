        <h3>Homework 1</h3>
        <h4>VR Fails video</h4>
        <h5>First scenario</h5>
        <p>Let’s consider a VR game when you have to avoid projectiles to win.
            When you have to walk in a VR environment, there’s a risk to run into walls or different objects. This type of accident, present from the very first seconds of the video, is probably the most frequent.</p>
        <p>Solution :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Pragmatical solution) Before the game, ask the player to keep out the objects that could cause problems, like tables. </li>
            <li>(Technological solution) Create a program that allows players to map the walls before playing. For example, he could walk along the walls with the VR headset or a controller, and the program store the position of the walls. In game, if the player comes too close to a wall (closer than a distance chosen by the player), the game can display the walls in a very striking color or a characteristic pattern</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Second scenario</h5>
        <p>For the second scenario, let’s consider sports games. In these game, you can practice boxing, bowling, golf, football. You may have to perform large movements with your legs and/or arms. This can lead to accidental injury to humans or animals passing close to the player.</p>
        <p>Solution :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Pragmatical solution) Limit you playing area with physical barriers to prevent people from coming in</li>
            <li>(Technological solution) The headset could use sensor to detect moving bodies close to the player. When this happens, the headset informs the player by displaying an alert in the field of vision telling the position of the object (and potentially its distance) and triggering a buzzing sound. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The CAVE system</h4>
        <p>Unlike Head-Mounted displays, the CAVE system does not cover the eyes of the user. It just displays the virtual environment of the user on fixed screens, and not in a headset. The user can move freely in a designed area and see all physical objects in it, including its own body.</p>
        <p>Advantages for the CAVE system :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cause the user can see his own body, the walls and the objects present in the room, he can walks freely without risking to bump into surrounding obstacles. The “VR fails” video shows us that this risk is not absent from Head-Mounted displays”</li>
            <li>The users is in a specialized isolated room, and so experiences without external perturbations, like we can have with Head-Mounted displays at home now. </li>
            <li>As explained in the paper, as VR technologies, the CAVE system allow the user to see virtual objects at different angles, what increases the realism and the suspension of disbelief.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages for the CAVE system :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Because the eyes are not completely covered, the user is always conscient that he’s in the reality. It could tend to reduce immersion</li>
            <li>As mentioned in the paper, the physical objects present in the CAVE room can prevent the user from viewing virtual items even if they’re supposed to be closer to him. There is no problem in Head-Mounted devices cause all is virtual in this type of technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common disadvantages with VR headsets :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Both suffer from visual acuity of what is displayed. For the CAVE system, the difference of acuity between your own body, that you see directly, and the virtual items displayed can be uncomfortable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            About the place of the CAVE system in the Reality-Virtuality Continuum
            In the Cave system, the only real elements the user can see is its own body. All the rest is displayed on screen. For that reason, the CAVE system should be located between Augmented Virtuality and Virtual Reality, cause it does not really include real objects to the experience, excluding the participants.
            With the same argument, we can remark that this system can’t be considered as purely virtual because the user can see an part of the reality.
            So I would have placed it here (in the following image) :
        </p>
        <p>
            When more people are experiencing the CAVE system at the same time, they can interact between them. This adds more real interactions to the experience. However, all the environment is still displayed on screens, so the system could not be considered as
